# Arrow Functions in JavaScript

Welcome to Arrow Functions in JavaScript.  The purpose of the project is to investigate the arrow functions in JavaScript.
Two functions - sum and treble are provided.

## UX

There is another way to write functions in JavaScript.  This is in the form of arrow functions.  Use the const keyword.

    const sum = (num1, num2) => {
        return num1 + num2;
    };

As a user, I expect to view whole numbers and real numbers for each function.
